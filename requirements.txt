# Core dependencies
# NOTE: Install PyTorch separately.
# For GPU machines, the correct wheel depends on your CUDA runtime and GPU arch
# (e.g. RTX 5090 = SM120 may require a newer/nightly wheel). Use
# [`scripts/fix_torch.py`](scripts/fix_torch.py:1) or [`setup.sh`](setup.sh:1)
# before running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
# Pin transformers to a known-stable range.
# Newer transformers releases may require newer PyTorch APIs (e.g., pytree),
# which can break environments with older torch wheels.
transformers>=4.41.0,<4.46.0
accelerate>=0.24.0
peft>=0.7.0
bitsandbytes>=0.41.0
psutil>=5.9.0
huggingface_hub>=0.20.0

# Quantization
# Optional: GPTQ tooling (not required for the benchmark runner's 4-bit BnB path).
# `auto-gptq` frequently compiles native/CUDA extensions and may fail if PyTorch
# is not installed yet. Install from [`requirements_gptq.txt`](requirements_gptq.txt:1)
# after PyTorch is available.

# PiSSA (optional)
# The pipeline's default "PiSSA" stage in this repo is implemented via PEFT/LoRA
# in [`scripts/pissa_extraction.py`](scripts/pissa_extraction.py:1) and does not
# require installing the official PiSSA repo.
# Official repo (only if you want upstream implementation):
# https://github.com/GraphPKU/PiSSA

# GaLore
galore-torch>=1.0.0

# SpinQuant (optional)
# This repo includes an in-repo "SpinQuant-lite" implementation in
# [`scripts/spinquant.py`](scripts/spinquant.py:1). Install the official repo
# only if you specifically need it:
# https://github.com/ModelTC/SpinQuant

\section{Limitations and Discussion}
\label{sec:limits}

\paragraph{Draft status of results.}
At the time of writing, the benchmark harness is implemented and the tables in \cref{sec:results} are placeholders.
Final numbers will be inserted once the full benchmark sweep completes.

\paragraph{Fixed rotations are a pragmatic choice.}
While learned rotations (as in SpinQuant) can further reduce quantization error, they can be expensive for large models.
We default to blockwise Hadamard rotations for bounded runtime; this may not be optimal for every layer or architecture.

\paragraph{Scope.}
This work focuses on a practical adaptation and quantization pipeline rather than proposing a new quantizer or a new adapter family.
The primary contribution is the integration and the accompanying mathematical viewpoint.
